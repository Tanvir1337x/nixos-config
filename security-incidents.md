# About

This repository contains a list of security incidents that have been reported in the wild. The incidents are categorized by type and include information about the affected software, the CVEs, and the solution or mitigation steps. Tracking security incidents is important for security researchers, developers, and users to stay informed about the latest vulnerabilities and take necessary actions to protect their systems.

## 1. Universal Local Privilege Escalation ([#3](https://github.com/TanvirOnGH/nixos-config/issues/3))

### 1. CVEs

- CVE-2024-1086

### 1. Description

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `netfilter: nf_tables` component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The `nft_verdict_init()` function allows positive values as drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the `nf_hook_slow()` function can cause a double free vulnerability when `NF_DROP` is issued with a drop error which resembles `NF_ACCEPT`.

### 1. Info

- **Type:** Privilege Escalation
- **Environment:** Local
- **Scope:** Universal
- **Affected Kernel:** v5.14 to v6.6
- **Success Rate:** 99.4% (KernelCTF images)

### 1. Solution/Mitigation

- Do not use any of the affected kernel versions.
- NIST NVD recommends upgrading past commit `f342de4e2f33e0e39165d8639387aa6c19dff660`.
- Ubuntu recommends:
  - If not needed, disable the ability for unprivileged users to create namespaces. To do this temporarily, run:

    ```sh
    sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0
    ```

  - To disable across reboots, run:

    ```sh
    echo kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-disable-unpriv-userns.conf
    ```

## 4. Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution Vulnerability in OpenSSH Server ([#7](https://github.com/TanvirOnGH/nixos-config/issues/7))

## 4. CVEs

- CVE-2024-6387

## 4. Description

A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present in portable OpenSSH versions between 8.5p1 and 9.7p1 (inclusive) that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

OpenBSD systems are unaffected by this bug, as OpenBSD developed a secure mechanism in 2001 that prevents this vulnerability.

## 4. Info

Name: regreSSHion
Type: Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution Vulnerability
Scope: OpenSSH’s server (sshd) in glibc-based linux systems
Affects:

- OpenSSH versions earlier than 4.4p1 are vulnerable to this signal handler race condition unless they are patched for CVE-2006-5051 and CVE-2008-4109.

- Versions from 4.4p1 up to, but not including, 8.5p1 are not vulnerable due to a transformative patch for CVE-2006-5051, which made a previously unsafe function secure.

- The vulnerability resurfaces in versions from 8.5p1 up to, but not including, 9.8p1 due to the accidental removal of a critical component in a function.

## 4. Solution/Mitigation

Check any exposed Linux glibc systems running OpenSSH and patch them if they are vulnerable.

[Temporary solution on nixos based systems as suggested by Qualys](https://github.com/nix-community/srvos/pull/449). Basically set this to your nixos config and redeploy & restart ssh service:

```nix
services.openssh.settings.LoginGraceTime = 0;
```

Note: It makes you vulnerable to a denial of service attack.
