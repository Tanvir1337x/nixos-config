# Security Considerations

This NixOS configuration prioritizes performance over security. While it includes some security features, it's important to recognize that no system is entirely secure, and this configuration is no exception. Users should be aware of potential security risks and take appropriate measures to address them.

## Potential Security Risks

Even with the included security features, be aware of the following risks:

- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** The configuration might be exposed to unknown vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched.
  
- **Social Engineering:** Users could be deceived into installing malicious software or revealing sensitive information through social engineering.

- **Misconfiguration:** Errors in configuration could create security vulnerabilities.

- **Physical Security:** An attacker with physical access to the system could potentially bypass security measures.

This analysis is intended for informational purposes and does not cover every possible risk. Users are ultimately responsible for securing their systems.
